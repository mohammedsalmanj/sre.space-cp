# File: infra/otel-config.yaml
# Layer: Infrastructure / Observability
# Purpose: Configuration for the OpenTelemetry Collector.
# Problem Solved: Ingests, processes, and exports telemetry (traces, metrics, logs)
#                 to multiple backends (Jaeger, New Relic) for observability.
# Interaction: Receives data from instrumented apps via OTLP; exports to backends.
# Dependencies: OpenTelemetry Collector (Docker/K8s)
# Inputs: OTLP spans, metrics, and logs
# Outputs: Telemetry exported to jaeger and newrelic
